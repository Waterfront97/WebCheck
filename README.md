# WebCheck
*Start logging your internet connection.*

I always have trouble with my internet provider.
I want to know when my internet connection at home works or not.

So I wrote this small NodeJS app to log internet connection issues and run it on my RaspberryPi at home.

Have fun :)

### Install instructions
* `npm install` to install dependencies
* `node index.js` starts logging and webserver

*Optional:*
* Use Systemd/Forever to restart script on exception
